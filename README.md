Struggeling about building React apps with being able to develop backend services:

* create-react-app:
  - I don't know where to config the server to add some backend features.
* Install express app:
  - Yeah, adding React later seems to be fair. But ES6 is so cool that I don't want to type ES5 anymore! Babel, webpack are solutions,
    but I don't know where the heck should I add them to.
    
NO MORE SUFFERING!!!!

This app is the combination of create-react-app (React, ES6, Babel, Webpack) and Node.js server (Express). create-react-app is inside
express app.
Freely modify at index.js!
